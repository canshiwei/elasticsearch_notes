# Basic Concept

## Overview

* Elasticsearch is developed in Java
* Elasticsearch provides real-time search and analytics for all types of data
* Use Apache Lucene as search framwork

## Key Concept

### Index structure
  * Contents are stored as "Document" using JSON format
  * Field is the smallest unit of data in elasticsearch. It can contain a list of multiple values of the same type.
  * Document is a group of fields.
  * _index, _type and _id as uniquely identifier
    * _index: logical namespace of one or multiple physical sharding.
    * _type: multiple different type can exist in an index
    * _id: generated by system or user 
  * example: 
      ```
      {
        "name": "Avengers: Endgame"
        "producer"‎: "‎Kevin Feige"	
        "company"‎: ‎"Marvel Studios"
      }
      ```

      is stored as

      ```
      {
        "_index": "movie",
        "_type": "_meta",
        "_id": "123",
        "_version": 1,
        "_seq_no": 0,
        "_primary_term": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Avengers: Endgame"
          "producer"‎: "‎Kevin Feige"	
          "company"‎: ‎"Marvel Studios"
        }
      }
      ```

### Shard
  * Shard is basic r/w unit, enables parallel r/w opration
  * Two types of data: 
    * primary shard
    * replica shard
    * Elasticsearch ensures that primary and the replica of the same shard will not collocate in the same node
    ![](./img/shard.png)
  * Relationship between index and shard
    * Every index contains multiple shards
    * Every shards is a lucene index
    * Every lucene index contains multiple segment, using inverted indexing
    * Every segment composed of multiple field
    * Every field associate with multiple term

### Cluster
  ![](./img/cluster.png)
  * Distributed cluster: 
    * Master-Slave: 
      * ES, HDFS, HBase
    * Dynamo:
      * Cassandra
  * Role of Nodes
    * Master Node:
      * Manipulate cluster related operation
      * Set `node.master: true` enable the node qualified to be choosed as master
      * Unique in the cluster
      * Each Master-eligible node should know the number of Master-eligible nodes. 
      * To avoid multiple master been elected (brain split) when network partition, setting of `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` as the result of `(master_eligible_nodes / 2) + 1`
    * Data Node: store data that contains indexed document. Set `node.data: true` enable node to be a data node
    * Ingest Node: A way to process a document in pipeline mode before indexing the document. Set `node.ingest: true` to enable ingest.
    * Coordinating Node: if all three roles are disabled, the node will only act as a coordination node that perform routing request.  
  

## Basic Elasticsearch configuration
* config folder: 
  * elasticsearch.keystore
  * elasticsearch.yml: main configuration file, which contains settings of clusters, nodes, and paths
    ![](./img/esyml.png)
  * jvm.options
  * users_roles
  * roles.yml
  * role_mapping.yml
  * log4j2.properties: Uses Log4j 2 for logging
  * users


## Running Elasticsearch
 
* Run

	```
	cd elasticsearch-7.0.0
	./bin/elasticsearch
	```

	![](./img/run.png)

* Test if start successfully

	```
	curl http://localhost:9200
	```
	The response is a json objects

	```
  {
    "name" : "Canshis-MBP",
    "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
    "cluster_uuid" : "-qZP4yCCSgmRf9ODqOMDcw",
    "version" : {
      "number" : "7.5.1",
      "build_flavor" : "default",
      "build_type" : "tar",
      "build_hash" : "3ae9ac9a93c95bd0cdc054951cf95d88e1e18d96",
      "build_date" : "2019-12-16T22:57:37.835892Z",
      "build_snapshot" : false,
      "lucene_version" : "8.3.0",
      "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
      "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
    },
    "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
  }
	```

* Install plugin

  ```
  bin/elasticsearch-plugin list
  bin/elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-icu
  ```

  Check if the plugin installed successfully

  ```
  curl localhost:9200/_cat/plugins
  >> Canshis-MBP analysis-icu 7.5.1
  ```
