#	Learning Plan 
(Schedule are based on Exam Objectives of Elastic Certified Engineer): 

* Week 1: Installation and Configuration
	* Deploy and start an Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Configure the nodes of a cluster to satisfy a given set of requirements
	* Secure a cluster using Elasticsearch Security
Define role-based access control using Elasticsearch Security


* Week 2: Indexing Data
	* Define an index that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Perform index, create, read, update, and delete operations on the documents of an index
	* Define and use index aliases
	* Define and use an index template for a given pattern that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Define and use a dynamic template that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Use the Reindex API and Update By Query API to reindex and/or update documents
	* Define and use an ingest pipeline that satisfies a given set of requirements, including the use of Painless to modify documents



* Week3: Queries
	* Write and execute a search query for terms and/or phrases in one or more fields of an index
Write and execute a search query that is a Boolean combination of multiple queries and filters
	* Highlight the search terms in the response of a query
	* Sort the results of a query by a given set of requirements
	* Implement pagination of the results of a search query
	* Use the scroll API to retrieve large numbers of results
	* Apply fuzzy matching to a query
	* Define and use a search template
	* Write and execute a query that searches across multiple clusters
	

* Week 4: Review and documentation (may need to catch up week 1, 2, 3)
	* Summery 1: Indexing & Query

* Week 5: Aggregations
	* Write and execute metric and bucket aggregations
	* Write and execute aggregations that contain sub-aggregations


* Week 6: Mappings and Text Analysis
	* Define a mapping that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Define and use a custom analyzer that satisfies a given set of requirements
	* Define and use multi-fields with different data types and/or analyzers
	* Configure an index so that it properly maintains the relationships of nested arrays of objects


* Week 7: Cluster Administration
	* Allocate the shards of an index to specific nodes based on a given set of requirements
	* Configure shard allocation awareness and forced awareness for an index
	* Diagnose shard issues and repair a cluster’s health
	* Backup and restore a cluster and/or specific indices
	* Configure a cluster for use with a hot/warm architecture
	* Configure a cluster for cross cluster search


* Week 8: Review and documentation (may need to catch up week 5, 6, 7)
	* Summery 2: Aggregations, Mappings & Cluster
